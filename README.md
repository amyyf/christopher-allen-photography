[x] Dynamic routing
[x] Routing between images in album - back/forward nav
[x] Upwards nav back to home
[x] Basic album page
[x] Basic image page
[x] Layout wrapper for all routes: <https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts#single-shared-layout-with-custom-app>
[x] Informative error messaging
[x] Styles! Responsive!
[x] Fix nav arrows in galleries to wrap to beginning
[x] Page for all albums
[x] Dynamic page title
[x] Sort albums from Contentful consistently
[ ] Size images from Contentful appropriately for album layout; can images be pre-fetched for speed?
-> putting height/width into the Contentful query significantly slowed down image render
[ ] Put loading and error components into appropriate slots
[ ] Nav bar different mobile layout?
[ ] Contentful credit in footer?
[ ] Finalize fonts and color scheme for all components, including error
[x] Hover styles
[ ] Finalize layout (footer at botttom of viewport, loaders, errors, grid content) to minimize content shifting
[x] Pretty urls (maybe, nice to have)
